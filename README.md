This game is a paddle and ball game where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball from falling off the screen. The objective is to survive for 30 seconds without the ball touching the bottom edge. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle horizontally. The ball starts in the middle of the screen and bounces off the walls and the paddle. Each time the ball hits the paddle, it increases speed slightly, making the game more challenging. If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the game ends in failure. If the player manages to keep the ball from falling for the entire 30 seconds, they win. The game also features a "Play Again" button that appears when the game ends, allowing players to restart the game by clicking the button. This game includes many special features to enhance the players experience. A visable countdown timer displays the remaining time, adding a sense of urgency and excitment as the player races against the clock.
